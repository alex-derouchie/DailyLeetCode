    "Our approach to this solution is essentially to use a DFS search over the grid 2D array to trace the final location of each ball in the starting array (there is a ball which starts at each index of grid[0]). During our DFS search for each ball, if the current row of the grid reaches the end of the array, we return the ball's final position (col). Otherwise, if col ever falls below zero or above the length of the grid, the ball has hit the left or right wall and doesn't reach the bottom (return -1). This is also the case when the ball reaches a \"V\" (when the cell to the right/left of the current cell, depending on the direction, is not equal to the current cell's value.) After conducting all the searches, we simply return the result array. This algorithm runs in worst case O(mn), where m*n is the size of the input array."
