    "We use a mathematical approach to solve this problem. We observe that the size of the final schedule (which is all we need to return) is equal to the number of tasks plus any idles, so we focus on calculating the amount of idles. We count up the amount each task occurs, keeping track of the maximum frequency and how many different tasks have that frequency (i.e. if 'A' and 'B' both have 4 occurences). Since a task can only occur every n steps, we know that the schedule will be divided into intervals of size n. The amount of intervals is equal to the max frequency-1 in order to sufficiently spread the most common letter. we update the size of the interval to account for the amount of most common tasks (if there are 3 different tasks tied for most frequent, they all need space in the interval). We can calculate the remaining spaces by multiplying the updated interval size by the amount of intervals. Since we've already populated the schedule with the most common elements, we know the rest of the elements can fit in between them. We calculate the amount of idles by subtracting the amount of remaining elements by the available spaces (or zero if no idles are needed)"
