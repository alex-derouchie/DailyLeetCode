    "This solution uses a dictionary to map pattern characters to their respective words. It starts by splitting the string, then checks to ensure that there are the same number of words as there are characters in the pattern string, and that there is the same amount of unique words as there are unique pattern characters. After verifying this, it loops through the words list. If the current pattern character is in the pattern dictionary but the current word is not equal to the contents of the dictionary at that index, the pattern is not a match. If the dictionary does not yet contain that pattern letter, it is added to the dictionary and the loop continues. If the loop completes, the pattern is a match.\n",
