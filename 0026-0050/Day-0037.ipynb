    "Since we're only returning repeated sequences that are 10 characters long, we can use an iterative approach with a hashmap to solve this problem.<br> To produce a solution, we loop through the string and for each character, we attempt to retrieve the value from the dictionary at the key corresponding to the 10 character substring starting at character i.<br> If the value doesn't exist, we add an integer value of 1 at that location, indicating it has been seen before (for future iterations).<br> If the value at that location of the dictionary does exist and is set to 1, we know that we've seen that sequence before and it has not been added to the final result List. We add the sequence to the list and set the value of the dictionary at the current key to 2 to avoid duplicate insertions.<br> At the end of the loop we have produced our final result."
